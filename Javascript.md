# JAVASCRIPT
### THE FINAL CONTENDER

Javascript is the last piece of the puzzle in creating an amazing web page. Now that you've learned *[HTML](https://rtruneh.github.io/reading-notes/Designing.html)* and *[CSS](https://rtruneh.github.io/reading-notes/chapter11.html)* you will now have a better understanding of how they layer. 

**HTML** is your base layer. This is where you provide the content of the site. You would use `<script>` to tell the browser to load the JS file. 

**CSS** is your presentation layer, this is where you enhance the content by adding images, colors, fonts etc. 

The **Javascript** is the behavior layer. This is where you can change how the page behaves and adding interactivity. 

Keeping these three elements in different files makes it easier for coding, but more experienced coders may choose to combine. It's all a personal preference.
