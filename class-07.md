# Domain Modeling #

According to codefellows' github, domain modeling is the process of creating a model in code for a specific problem to describe the entities, attributes, behaviors and constraints that govern the problem. It's a great communication tool among group members as it helps to define vocabulary to be used between technical and business teams.
