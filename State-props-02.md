# REACT: Component Lifecycle Events #

In react you can define components as classes or functions with the methods being called lifecycle events. There are three phases of this cycle: 
1. Mounting - during this phase a component is created and inserted into the DOM. 

2. Updating - when a component is updated or state changes and is rerendered. 

3. Unmounting - the final phase when a component is being removed from DOM.
