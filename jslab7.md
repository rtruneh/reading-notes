##### This will give you an overview of things learned in the following pages of the JavaScript and JQuery book: 
    - Pages 1-24
    - Pages 74-79
    - Pages 88-94

#### JavaScript in the browser: 
pages 1-24

Changing contect of an HTML while it's loaded is important because it should have the ability to: 
    - *ACCESS* content of the page. 
    - *MODIFY* content of the page. 
    - *PROGRAM* rules or instructions the browser can follow. 
    - *REACT* to evets triggered by the user or browser. 

### ***What is a script and how do I create one?***
pages 74-79

A *script* is a series of instructions that a computer will follow to achieve the goal give. The same way we follow recipes, handbooks or manuals to create. 

1. Define the goal: 
>Like anything else, before you start writing a script, you need to have a goal in mind and list the tasks needed to achieve that goal. A computuer doesn't quite learn like humans, they solve problems programmatically. So it needs very specific instructions for every time it performs the task. 
2. Design the script
>Use a flow chart to help you answer each step with yes or no and to figure out how to proceed depending on the answer. 
3. Code each step
>List the steps you come up with from the flow chart and use each step as a line of code. 


### Basic JavaScript Instructions

1. *Expressions* can assign a value to a variable that'll give you an output:
>>`var color = 'beige';` makes the value beige
>>`var area = 3 * 2;` used two numbers to return a value of 6.  

2. *Operators* are relied upon by expressions. These allow programmers to create a single value from one or more value. 
    - Arithmetic operators: perform basic math
        - Numbers within parentheses will compute first. If you do not use these characters, PEMDAS will be applied.
    - String operators: Combine strings ie: `greeting = 'Hi'+'Molly';`
        - Combining strings to create a new one is called *concatenation*.

### What is a function 
pages 88-94

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. It uses *parameters* (information passed to the function) to provide information ie: to get the area of an object it needs the width and height. The answer is called a *return value*
