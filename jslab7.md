### ***What is a script and how do I create one?***

A *script* is a series of instructions that a computer will follow to achieve the goal give. The same way we follow recipes, handbooks or manuals to create. 

1. Define the goal: 

>Like anything else, before you start writing a script, you need to have a goal in mind and list the tasks needed to achieve that goal. A computuer doesn't quite learn like humans, they solve problems programmatically. So it needs very specific instructions for every time it performs the task. 

2. Design the script

>Use a flow chart to help you answer each step with yes or no and to figure out how to proceed depending on the answer. 


3. Code each step

>List the steps you come up with from the flow chart and use each step as a line of code.
