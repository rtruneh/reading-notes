# *COLOR*

#### Let's bring some life into your creations to help make your page stand out. Color is an important factor in drawing and keeping peoples attention on your site. 

##### Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing RED, GREEN and Blue. 

#### There are three ways you can specify color in CSS: 
> RGB Values
    : this expresses color in how much is used to make it up. It uses numbers from 0 to 255.

> HEX Codes
    : uses 6 digit codes preceeded by `#` to express how much color is used to make the color needed. 

> Color Names
    : There are 147 color names to choose from

#### Alternatives
> HSL: an alternative way to specify colors. the value starts with "hsl" followed by values for hue, saturation and lightness.

> HSLA: allows you to specify colors uses the same thing as the HSL except it adds a fourth value...transparency. 

#### Things to consider.

##### *Contrast* , *hue* , *saturation*, *Opacity* and *brightness* are some of the things that make a difference in the colors and how they work together. 
> Contrast: Be mindful in how the colors lay on each other. 
    > Low contrast is more difficult to read. 
    > High Contrast is very clear but better for headers and quick reads.
    > Medium contrast is better for longer reads. 
    
> Opacity is created with an alpha value between 0.0 and 1.0 added to an RGB value. 
    > Hue is the colloquial idea of color.
    > Saturation is the amount of gray in a color. 
    > Brightness is the amount of white or black in a color.
