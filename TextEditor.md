# *TEXT EDITORS*

So you've played around in [GitHub](github.com) and dabbled in some exercises there but you want a little more? 
The next step is to locate and download files and programs that will allow you to code from your own computer. 
Utilizing a command window to enter your codes and text editors to help you work efficiently and put out quality content. 

The process of downloading the neccessary tools can be tedious. ***Take your time here.***
This is not the place to rush through or attempt to do things without fully reading and understanding all parts of the directions. 
If you run into any issues reach out to your peers and if all else fails...*Google* will be your best friend. 

# **Types of text editors**

## ***Basic***

We've all opened up the *Notepad* on a windows based computer and played with it as a kid. This is an example of a basic editor.
These are things that are already built into your computer or the programs on your laptop/computer that gives you the ability
to write basic code wihtout any frills. This is coding at it's most basic level and doesn't have any of the benefits as the newer editors. 

## ***Code Specific***

Are a good medium between basic and IDE. These programs offer features that allow you to be write and manage the text used to build a site. Some important things to look for that will help you in your developing career are: 
1. Code Completion: this allows the software to offer suggestions on how to finish the code based on how you start. It can also end a line if it's started with a quote or hashtag. 
2. Syntax highlighting and themes: adds color to your screen. These rules of the colors can be changed so that a copy will be different than elements and you can quickly ready and go to the line you need to. 
3. Extensions: thes are plugins for your editor to help with efficiency.

## ***IDE***

IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. 
According to coder [Atom](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf)
>It's a suite of different software that is a text editor, file manager, complier and debugger in one. 
 


Picking an editor is personal preference, some will offer more of what you are looking for even if you hear someone raving about another one. 
Go with what feels right and gives you what you need and allows you to enter and visualize how you need to. Since tech is consistently growing, 
try not to get stuck on one for too long. You'd be surprised with what changes have been made since the last time you used any specific program.
