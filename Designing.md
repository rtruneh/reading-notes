# Process & Design

### START HERE 

First things first...*Who is your audience?*

Before you can even begin to imagine the sequence of coding that is required to create a web page for yourself or a client, you need to think about the target audience. 

Who is going to be visiting the site? What are they going to be looking for? How often will they frequent the page? 

These type of questions will help you figure out howw to create a page that will help bring people in and keep them engaged. 

### NEXT STEP

Create a *SITEMAP*
    > A diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site.

You should start with the homepage and then to help decide what information you should put on each page you use a technique called *card sorting*. 

    > Involves placing information on separate pieces of paper and then organizing the related information into groups. 

### THEN

Crate a *WIREFRAME*

    > A simple sketh of the key information that needs to go on each page site. It'll show the hierarchy of the informationa and how much space it'll require on the page. 

This will help you ensure all the informaiton neccessary is included. 

### IMPORTANT THINGS

***Organize***

> *Grouping* together related content into *blocks* or *chunks* to make the page look similar. Present certain information in a similar visual style.

        > Grouping and similarity types
            >> Proximity: items placed close together
            >> Continuance: Items placed in a line or curve
            >> White space: related items close together
            >> Color: placed behind related items
            >> Borders: line around border of group
            
***Prioritizing***

> Make parts of the page look distinct from surrounding content, draw attention to or away from certain items. Create a *visual hierarchy* to help users focus on key messages and guide them to subsequent messages.
        
        > Visual Hierarchy
            >> The order in which your eyes perceive what they see.
