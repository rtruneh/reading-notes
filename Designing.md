# Process & Design

### START HERE 

First things first...*Who is your audience?*

Before you can even begin to imagine the sequence of coding that is required to create a web page for yourself or a client, you need to think about the target audience. 

Who is going to be visiting the site? What are they going to be looking for? How often will they frequent the page? 

These type of questions will help you figure out howw to create a page that will help bring people in and keep them engaged. 

### NEXT STEP

Create a *SITEMAP*
    > A diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site.

You should start with the homepage and then to help decide what information you should put on each page you use a technique called *card sorting*. 
    > Involves placing information on separate pieces of paper and then organizing the related information into groups. 

### THEN

Crate a *WIREFRAME*
    >A simple sketh of the key information that needs to go on each page site. It'll show the hierarchy of the informationa and how much space it'll require on the page. 

This will help you ensure all the informaiton neccessary is included.
