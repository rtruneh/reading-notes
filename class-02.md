# COMMIT

Commits are the best ways to communicate your context about a change to fellow developers. It should tell the person reading it *why* the changes happened.

As a team, you should come up with a game plan on what commit message convention you want to use. This should help to define at least the **style**, **content** and **MetaData**. 
> *Style* is the markup syntax, wrap margins, grammar, capitalization, punctuation etc. This will help the log to remain consistent. 

> *Content* is about what kind of information the body of the commit message should or should not contain. 

> *MetaData* is how tracking IDs for issues, pull request numbers etc should be referenced.

## 7 Rules of a great *commit* message

According to Chris Beams ther are seven rules for a great commit message:

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line

2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters

    -If you have a hard time summarizing then you need to commit more often.

3. Capitalize the subject line

    -As simple as it sounds...start every subject like a new sentence.

4. Do not end the subject line with a period

5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line

    -*Imparative mood* means "spoken/written as if giving a command. Try not to use *indicative mood* when writing, which is all about reporting facts. A good commit line should be able to finish the below sentence: 
    > 'If applied, this commit wil...'

6. Wrap the body at 72 characters

7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
