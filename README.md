My name is Rosa Truneh. A mother of a 9 year old with a colorful background in accounting, food and beverage, management, real estate and now coding. Constantly looking for new ways to better myself, I consider every day the chance to do that. As a forever student I look forward to the challenge. I am ready and willing to be taught and open to connect.
