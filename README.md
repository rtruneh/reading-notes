My name is Rosa Truneh. I am a lover of all things learning. A mother of a 9 year old with a colorful background in Accounting, food and beverage, management, real estate and now coding. This will be new, exciting and tiring but I'm looking forward to the challenge. I am ready and willing to be taught and open to connect.
