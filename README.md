# **Growth Mindset**

Mahatma Gandhi said 
> *"Live as if you were to die tomorrow; learn as if you were to live forever."* 

Growth mindset is allowing pathways to remain opened so that possibilites are never capped. It's a mental exercise of learning how to love learning. 

## **Maintaining a growth mindset:**

#### POSITIVITY
-Make it a habit to speak in a gentle and positive manner to yourself through out the day. We are our own worst critics but learn to change the narrative by being your biggest cheerleader. Remind yourself of how smart and amazing and capable you already are and see if you don't take on tasks with a higher perspective. 
#### NO CAP 
- ***YET*** is your new favorite word. Do not limit yourself by saying you ~~can't~~. Success doesn't happen without failure, take fear by the horns and let it know who is boss of your life. You never know where you can get to if you don't ever try.
#### ACCOUNTABILITY
- Get you a support system that will help to keep you above the waves when you feel like it's all starting to get overwhelming. People who can give you a reminder of what you've already accomplisehd and how much more you have within yourself. We aren't meant to do this thing called *lIFE* alone...so use ALL your resources.
